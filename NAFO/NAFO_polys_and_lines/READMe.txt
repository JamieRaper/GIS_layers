The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) Secretariat, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) and the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) have collaborated to update the spatial representation of the NAFO Subareas,
Divisions, and Subdivisions as defined in Annex 1 to the Convention on Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries (2020) (https://www.nafo.int/Portals/0/PDFs/key-publications/NAFOConvention.pdf).

The NAFO Convention does not indicate which datum should be used for spatial representation. 
The datum used at the time of development of the NAFO Convention would have been North American Datum 1927 (NAD27). 
However, all datasets were derived using NAD83.

International boundaries have been updated based on accepted coordinates between the USA and Canada 
(http://www.internationalboundarycommission.org/en/maps-coordinates/coordinates.php),
 and Canada and Greenland (https://www.treaty-accord.gc.ca/text-texte.aspx?id=105136).

This version of the NAFO Divisions is not intended to be used for legal purposes and is being provided for mapping / illustrative purposes only.
