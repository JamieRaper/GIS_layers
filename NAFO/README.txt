NAFO Update

June 2022 by DK

The "Divisions" folder here has the clipped NAFO polygons from the NAFO_polys_and_lines folder, I stashed it in that folder so that it doesn't mess up any of our current functions
The NAFO_polys_and_lines folder has the version from the Open Canada portal circa late 2021
The Subareas folder has subareas that were obtained from NAFO in 2020, these appear to be identical to the Open Canada portal polygons excep these have the subareas whereas Open Canada only has main areas in there
